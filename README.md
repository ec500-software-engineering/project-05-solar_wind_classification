# Solar_Wind_Classification_No.1
This is a final projcet for EC500 Software Engineering

## Technology:
We present a four-category classification algorithm for the solar wind, based on Gaussian Process. The four categories are: ejecta, coronal hole origin plasma, streamer belt origin plasma, and sector reversal origin plasma. The algorithm is trained and tested on a labeled portion of the OMNI data set which will be updated per day till now.The raw data is with 7 features which are **Solar wind speed(Vsw)**,
**Proton temperature standard deviation(ùúéT)**, **Sunspot number(R)**, **Solar radio flux((10.7 cm) F10.7)**, **Alfven speed(vA)**, **Proton specific entropy(Sp)**, **and Temperature ratio(Texp‚àïTp)**.<br>
For these data, we plan to use Guassian process classification method.GP is a nonparametric statistical model, which has the advantage of producing probabilistic results, employing a Bayesian approach. This is a key feature that makes GP models different from most machine learning schemes. In particular, other classification schemes have the goal of finding the category boundaries in a multidimensional input space, unambiguously partitioning the input space into categories. The probabilistic approach is more flexible and informative, because it attaches a confidence level to predictions.<br>
